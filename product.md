		<p>A platform to simulate manasik in 3D environment. Features including networked multiplayer experience aimed for student in class guided by their teacher.<br><br>

		Development started by research of user needs to digitalize manasik, a training to familiriaze the act of umroh and hajj pilgrim, for use in school teaching. The process continues by developing minimum viable product to be tested in our partner school.
		Later during development, we also managed to add exam options to help teacher assess student learning activity using the platform. It has been tested multiple times in a user acceptance testing and ready to be deployed for learning at school usage.<br><br>

		The platform also has its own backend system, a dashboard to register student and admin for student listing, login and grading.</p>
