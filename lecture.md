<p>One day lecture to expose interactive virtual reality video production to Visual Communication Design students.<br><br>

My role was to provide pipeline explanation on interactive VR video development using Unity game engine to participants. At the time, development pipeline was intricate as SDK was still in early development. Game engine was also not as mature as in 2019 edition and later. Giving lecture on what to expect when developing VR content was necessary as standalone device had just entered the market.
