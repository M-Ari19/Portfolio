<p>Collaboration between artist collective "Tromarama" and Festivo, with the installation name "40ÂºC Fable (2021)". A motion sensor activation art for up to 6 people at the same time. Utilizing Kinect with Unreal Engine to produce a self mirror-like experience in front of three monitors setup. Displayed in Museum MACAN on December 2021 to May 2022.<br><br>

Process including discussion with the artist on how to achieve an interactive installation, including 3D character models modification to ensure support for game engine animation method. The 3D character models were then rigged, manually weight painted at some points to make sure body parts animated correctly. There were changes of concept during development which affect the number of desktop PC and Kinect to use, which drastically impact the complexity and added limitations such as the areas of interaction.<br><br>

Results were positive, children loved to play with their body double characters on the screen. Feel free to learn more from this <a href="https://www.museummacan.org/cas/the-lost-jungle?lang=en">archived page</a> of the installation on Museum MACAN's website.</p>

<p>Collaboration between artist Citra Sasmita and Festivo. A pandemic stricken situation pushed museum and artist to innovate on how to display the installation without breaking the lockdown rules: a virtual exhibition. Displayed in Museum MACAN on December 2020 to January 2021.<br><br>

Initial discussion with museum and artist was to bring AR experience for the museum visitor. The AR was utilizied using webAR platform, albeit minor inconvenience caused by processing capabilities of varied user device. The exhibition then expanded into the virtual landscape in web platform, utilizing virtual tour experience. The AR experience was also mimicked on the virtual tour experience.<br><br>

This collaboration resulted in increased museum web engagement. The virtual tour was also used as online guided tour for children online organized by their school.

<p>A mobile application aimed for motorcycle modification based on real world aftermarket parts. There are approximately ten parts to customize for each motorcycle. User may also change the color of various parts including body paint, wheels and leather seat.<br><br>

My task was to improve the looks of the body paint and optimizing material applied in Blender. Motorcycle models were pre-build, however the materials included are not optimized for use in real time rendering. Challenges were present with mobile target platform's limited processing resource. Shader used include the use of fresnel which resulted from layer painting in car or motorcycle paint.<br><br></p>
